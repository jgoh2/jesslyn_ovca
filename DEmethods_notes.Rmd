# Understanding Seurat functions 

## `FindNeighbors()`

##`AddModuleScore()`

## `FindAllMarkers()`

## `FindVariableFeatures()` 

Description: "Identifies features that are outliers"  


Inputs:
  1. Seurat object (object)
  2. Selection method (selection.method) - algorithm to use to select most variable features
  3. Number of Features (nfeatures) - number of genes to select as top variable, can only use when selection.method is not 'mvp'

selection.method:

  1. **vst** (appears to be similar to DESeq2)
    - fits a line to $log(variance)$ vs $log(mean)$ using local polynomial regression (loess).
    - standardizes feature values using observed mean and expected variance
    - feature variance is calculate on the standarized values after clipping to a maximum 
      + **clip.max**: After standardization values larger than clip.max will be set to clip.max; default is 'auto' which sets this value to the square root of the number of cells.
  2. **mean.var.plot (mvp)** (identify variable features whil controlling for relationship between variability and avg expression)
    - calculates average expression and dispersion for each feature
    - divides features into num.bin and calculates z-scores for dispersion within each bin
      + **num.bin**: total number of bins to use in the scaled analysis; default is 20
  3. **dispersion (disp)** simply selects the genes with the highest dispersion
